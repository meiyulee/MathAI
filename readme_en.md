## Pain points solved

When you are engaged in working researches, or need to analyze the regularities of numbers at work, the following difficulties have occurred and cannot be solved:

- It is always impossible to find out the accurate modelling results of the numbers. Even you try the best, the numbers' modelling cannot get the mathemtical function form.
- You always want to fit more mathematical functions to the number set and find the best one. Unfortunitly, there is no tools to assist your work.
- You intend and cannot find the regularities of the time-series numbers that might and could display the beginning and ending time points for the trends.
- You want to find out the regularity of numbers more objectively, so as to eliminate subjective identification and setting. Let numbers express their regularities and signals better.
- You want to build the mathematical models to find out the sorting rules of categories, instead of the comparison of differences between/among categories.

This software aims to become a superior tool solving the problems of finding a mathematical model for the number sets.

## The use

1. **Establish mathematical model for numbers** -Improve from regression analysis to find the best mathematical model for numbers. Without too many independent variables to explain the dependent variables, we can construct a mathematical model that conforms to the numbers.
2. You can arbitrarily set the explanatory power of the mathematical model, and you need to start a new estimation formula again.
3. You can choose any numerical example that users want to know. Txt file with paired samples, unlimited sample size.
4. You can arbitrarily set the minimum amount of data needed to start estimating the mathematical model. The current version setting must not be less than 10.

## Features

1. **Unique and creative** - data-driven mathematical modeling by artificial intelligence.
2. **Modelling tools for professionals** - Tool of mathematical modelling of the numbers, for professionals such as science, commerce, engineering, medicine, agriculture, and so on.
3. **Optimization of mathematical model by artificial intelligence** - Automatically check the mathematical models of numbers, and determine how many mathematical models are needed to achieve optimization to form a model of a number set.
4. **Massive Mathematical Function** - In the modeling process, AI selects the best model that conforms to the numbers from the massive mathematical functions or models.
5. **Being a mathematical model, non-regression analysis** - improved from regression analysis to the accurate mathematical modeling for numbers and it becomes a new method - lines combined method.
6. **Checking the correction of operation results** - Save the operation results such as the results of mathematical model and estimated value. You can import it into Excel to watch graphics.
7. **You can manually set the conditions that you want AI to judge** - The selection process of the mathematical model for numbers needs two parameter setting. One is "the difference R2". If the explanatory power decreases over the set value, the software will automatically run a new estimation. Second is "the minimum number". The second parameter determines the minimum data size required for each line to re-estimate. The latter can also be handed over to AI for judgement, so that data can speak its own regularity and key signals.

## What it can do

Including but not limited to

| Category | Description | Note |
|:----:| :---- |:----:|
| Establishing mathematical model of numbers | Use the improved regression analysis, called as lines combined method, to find the best mathematical model for numbers. | At present, provide AI mathematical modeling tools with two columns of paired samples.<br> unrelease the mutli-variables version. |
| Laboratory data | The experimental data of the experimental group and the control group can be used to find out the sorting rules of the groups, which brings the found rules of the adjusted order for the control variables, needed for the experiment. | A breakthrough from the past where only "comparative differences" could be achieved. |
| Time-series data | It can be used to find accurate mathematical models of trends, including time signals and trend turn signals. | From the previous way of only being able to do a two-point comparison, now it can really do an objective model finding and comparison of trend "lines". |
| Language Sorting | Sorting words by number, using it to run the sorting pattern | Later on, we can continue to do a variety of word sorting rules to get the most frequently occurring arrangement to achieve a more friendly human-computer interaction.  |
